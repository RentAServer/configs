# RentAServer Configs

This repository will contain all community-made configs for RentAServer.

If you have a custom gamemode/useful config, or even a tweak to an existing config, simply create a pull request or create an issue.

League configs
--------------

League configs are automatically updated and do not need to be here, unless it's an extension on a league config.

Layout
------

Configs should be in the game folder (i.e. tf, csgo, left4dead2, etc) under the correct path (tf/cfg, csgo/cfg, left4dead2/cfg, etc).
